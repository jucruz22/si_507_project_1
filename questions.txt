ASSIGNMENT QUESTIONS:
- How to put files in .gitignore? Trying to do this with .DS_Store and forgot the command

- Do you git commit virtual environments? Does this make sense to do if collaborating with other users?

- After adding necessary libraries to my VE, do I keep it activated as I: make changes to code > git commit, and > push to github?
